# LeonOS Project Documentation

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the LeonOS project, a Windows XP-inspired developer portfolio. It covers the purpose and functionality of each file and folder within the project structure.

## Root Directory Files

This section details the configuration files located in the root of the project.

### `.gitignore`

**Purpose:** This file specifies which files and folders should be ignored by Git, the version control system.

**Details:**
- **Dependencies:** Ignores `node_modules`, `.pnp`, and `.yarn` directories, which contain project dependencies that can be reinstalled from `package.json`.
- **Build Artifacts:** Excludes `.next` and `out` directories, which are generated by Next.js during the build process.
- **Environment Variables:** Ignores `.env*` files, which contain sensitive information like API keys and should not be committed to version control.
- **Other:** Excludes other miscellaneous files like `.DS_Store` (macOS), log files, and build information.

### `next.config.ts`

**Purpose:** This file is used to configure the Next.js framework.

**Details:**
- **`typescript.ignoreBuildErrors`:** This option is set to `true`, which allows the project to be built for production even if there are TypeScript errors. This is a potentially dangerous setting that should be used with caution.

### `package.json`

**Purpose:** This file is the heart of the Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project and a list of its dependencies.

**Details:**
- **`name`, `version`, `private`:** Basic project information.

## `src` Directory

The `src` directory contains the source code of the application.

### `src/app` Directory

This directory is the entry point for the Next.js application using the App Router.

- **`favicon.ico`:** The icon for the website, displayed in the browser tab.

- **`globals.css`:** This file contains global CSS styles that are applied to the entire application. It also includes the Tailwind CSS directives.

- **`head.tsx`:** This file defines the content of the `<head>` tag for the main page. It includes the title and meta description for the portfolio.

- **`layout.tsx`:** This is the root layout for the application. It wraps all pages and is used to define the global structure of the HTML document, including the `<html>` and `<body>` tags.

- **`page.tsx`:** This is the main page of the application. It renders the `Desktop` component, which is the core of the Windows XP-inspired UI. It also handles the initial loading state, showing a `WelcomeAnimation` before the desktop is displayed.

### `src/components` Directory

This directory contains all the React components that make up the user interface.

#### `WelcomeAnimation.tsx`

**Purpose:** This component displays a welcome animation that mimics the Windows XP boot screen before the main desktop is loaded.

**Details:**
- It uses `framer-motion` to create a spinning Windows logo and a fade-in "Welcome" text.
- The animation plays for a fixed duration (4 seconds), after which the `onComplete` callback is called to signal that the animation has finished.
- This component is rendered in `src/app/page.tsx` and is shown conditionally based on the loading state of the application.

#### `src/components/Apps` Directory

This directory contains the individual "applications" that can be opened as windows on the desktop. Each file represents a distinct feature or section of the portfolio.

- **`AboutMe.tsx`:** This component displays a personal introduction to the developer, including a summary, contact information, and a profile picture. It's designed to look like a classic Windows "About" dialog.

- **`Calculator.tsx`:** A functional calculator application that mimics the look and feel of the Windows XP calculator. It supports basic arithmetic operations, keyboard input, and a history of calculations.

- **`Calendar.tsx`:** A calendar application that allows users to view dates, navigate between months and years, and add simple notes to specific dates. The UI is styled to resemble the Windows XP calendar.

- **`ContactMe.tsx`:** A contact form that allows users to send a message to the developer. It uses `@emailjs/browser` to handle the email sending functionality and includes a custom message box for success and error notifications.

- **`ContactSocials.tsx`:** This component displays a list of social media links (Email, LinkedIn, GitHub) in a style that mimics the "Set Program Access and Defaults" window in Windows XP.

- **`DevShell.tsx`:** A simulated developer shell or command prompt. It allows users to type commands to get information about the portfolio, list projects, and even open project detail windows. It's a creative way to navigate the portfolio's content.

- **`Education.tsx`:** This component displays the developer's educational background. It fetches data from `src/lib/data/education.ts` and presents it in a clean, organized manner.

- **`Experience.tsx`:** This component showcases the developer's work experience. It fetches data from `src/lib/data/experience.ts` and displays it in a visually appealing way.

- **`MyResume.tsx`:** This component provides a summary of the developer's resume and includes a prominent button to download the full resume in PDF format.

- **`ProjectDetailWindow.tsx`:** This component is used to display the detailed information of a single project, including a larger image, a long description, the technologies used, and links to the live demo and GitHub repository. It is opened when a user clicks on a project in the `Projects.tsx` component or uses the `open` command in the `DevShell.tsx`.

- **`Projects.tsx`:** This component displays a grid of the developer's projects. Each project is presented as a card with an image, title, description, and links. Clicking on a project card opens the `ProjectDetailWindow.tsx` for that project.

- **`Skills.tsx`:** This component lists the developer's technical skills, categorized for clarity. The data is fetched from `src/lib/data/skills.ts`.

- **`TechStack.tsx`:** This component displays the technical stack of the portfolio project itself, presented in a style that mimics the "System Properties" window in Windows XP.

- **`ThemeSettings.tsx`:** A placeholder for a future theme settings application. It currently shows a disabled UI for changing the wallpaper and color scheme, indicating that this is a planned feature.

#### `src/components/common` Directory

This directory contains common, reusable components that are used across multiple applications.

- **`SectionHeader.tsx`:** This component is a reusable header for sections within the application windows. It displays a title and an icon with a gradient background, consistent with the Windows XP theme.

#### `src/components/Desktop` Directory

This directory contains the core components that create the Windows XP-style desktop environment.

- **`AppIcon.tsx`:** This component represents a single application icon on the desktop. It takes a title, icon source, and an `onClick` handler as props. When clicked, it triggers the function to open the corresponding application window.

- **`Desktop.tsx`:** This is the main component for the desktop. It renders the desktop wallpaper, the application icons, the `Taskbar`, the `StartMenu`, and all the open application windows. It uses the `useWindowStore` to manage the state of the open windows and handles the logic for opening new windows when an app icon is clicked.

- **`StartMenu.tsx`:** This component is the Windows XP-style start menu. It provides a list of all the available applications, which can be opened by clicking on them. It also includes a "Log Off" and "Turn Off" button. The start menu is opened by clicking the "Start" button on the `Taskbar`.

- **`Taskbar.tsx`:** This component is the taskbar at the bottom of the screen. It contains the "Start" button, a list of all the open application windows, and a system tray with a clock. The taskbar allows users to switch between open windows, minimize them, and restore them.

#### `src/components/ui` Directory

This directory contains general-purpose UI components.

- **`spinner.tsx`:** This component is a simple loading spinner that can be used to indicate that something is loading. It is used in the `WelcomeAnimation` component.

#### `src/components/Window` Directory

This directory contains the component responsible for creating the draggable, resizable, and interactive windows.

- **`Window.tsx`:** This is a complex component that creates a single application window. It uses the `react-rnd` library to provide the dragging and resizing functionality. It also manages the window's state, including its position, size, focus, and whether it is minimized or maximized. The window's header displays the title and icon of the application, along with minimize, maximize, and close buttons. The body of the window renders the content of the application, which is passed as a child to this component.

### `src/lib` Directory

This directory contains data and state management logic.

#### `src/lib/data` Directory

This directory contains the data used to populate the content of the portfolio. This makes it easy to update the portfolio's content without changing the components themselves.

- **`education.ts`:** This file exports an array of objects, where each object represents an educational item. This data is used by the `Education.tsx` component.

- **`experience.ts`:** This file exports an array of objects, where each object represents a work experience item. This data is used by the `Experience.tsx` component.

- **`projectImages.ts`:** This file imports all the project images from the `public/projects` directory and exports them as an object. This makes it easy to access the project images in the `projects.ts` file.

- **`projects.ts`:** This file exports an array of objects, where each object represents a project. This data is used by the `Projects.tsx` and `ProjectDetailWindow.tsx` components.

- **`skills.ts`:** This file exports an array of objects, where each object represents a skill category and a list of skills within that category. This data is used by the `Skills.tsx` component.

#### `src/lib/store` Directory

This directory contains the state management logic for the application.

- **`windowStore.ts`:** This file defines a Zustand store for managing the state of the application windows. Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable state-management solution. This store keeps track of all the open windows, their properties (id, title, content, position, size, etc.), and provides actions to add, remove, minimize, restore, and focus windows. This centralizes the window management logic and makes it easy to interact with the windows from any component.

### `src/types` Directory

This directory contains global TypeScript type definitions.

- **`global.d.ts`:** This file contains a declaration to extend the default React HTML attributes. It adds a `jsx` property, which is likely used by a styling library like `styled-jsx` to enable per-component scoped CSS.
